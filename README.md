#DSA-Basic_ARRAY
These are data structure and algorithm Functions. (ARRAY BASICS)
This repository contains basic DSA questions on arrays.
The code are in cpp but the java implementation is also similar.
These code can be used for learning purposes and would be helpfull to learn basic arrays.
The funtion implemented in the code contain driver code( "int main()" funtion in most cases) as well.
Comments are given to understand the code better.
